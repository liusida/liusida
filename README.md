âš¡ Recently, I had a strange feeling.

ðŸ”­ I feel that GitHub is like an open-world game where each repository is a unique city. You can explore these cities (browse code) and interact with locals (open issues, often getting quick responses). These cities are interconnected through dependencies, creating a vast network.

ðŸŒ± You can also build your own city (repository) and choose your profession (different languages, resources, tutorials). If your city connects to popular ones, visitors will come, and if they find it valuable, they'll leave stars (GitHub Stars) as recognition.
